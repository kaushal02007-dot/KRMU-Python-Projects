## Dataset
- Source: Daily Delhi Climate Dataset
- Rows: 1576
- Columns: date, meantemp, humidity, wind_speed, meanpressure
- Cleaned dataset saved as `cleaned_weather_data.csv`

## Insights

### 1. Temperature Trends
- Daily mean temperature fluctuates between 6°C to 38°C.
- Peak temperatures observed in May-June.

### 2. Humidity Trends
- Average humidity ranges from 50% to 100%.
- Higher humidity observed during Monsoon season.

### 3. Wind Speed
- Wind speed mostly below 10 km/h.
- Occasional high wind days (spikes in dataset).

### 4. Seasonal Observations
- Winter: Low temperature, moderate humidity
- Spring: Moderate temperature and humidity
- Monsoon: High humidity, moderate temperature
- Autumn: Moderate temperature, decreasing humidity

## Plots
- Daily Temperature Trend → `daily_temperature.png`
- Monthly Average Humidity → `monthly_humidity.png`
- Humidity vs Temperature → `scatter_humidity_temp.png`
- Combined Temperature & Humidity → `combined_temp_humidity.png`

## Conclusion
- The data shows clear seasonal patterns.
- Insights can help in campus sustainability initiatives (e.g., energy usage planning, weather preparedness).
